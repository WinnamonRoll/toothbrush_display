# toothbrush showcase box
## project description
In this project, I collaborated with a designer to design and build a simple interactive toothbrush display box for a dental care company. I was responsible for designing the mechanism, writing the schematics, and programming an Arduino Nano to control the box in C/C++. The toothbrushes will be moved back and forth using lead screw drives as customers interact with the box via buttons. Also, the customers can try using the toothbrush to brush the teeth model where the brushing weight will be monitored and shown on a mini OLED screen. This showcase box will allowed customers to get a sense of how heavy they regularly brush their teeth so that they can choose their next toothbrush approriately.
